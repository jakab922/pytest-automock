# Example project

This project contains a module called *simple_module* which defines dummy variables/functions that we can mock.

## What's here to see?

Mainly the *tests* folder. That's where you can see examples on how you should use the *pytest-automock* module.

Note that the directory structure of the *tests* folder must match the package's. That's how automock can figure
out what it should mock.
